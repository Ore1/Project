      <ol>
        <li>Cut the peppers, tomatoes, onions, and garlic/ginger into small bits and pour into the blender</li>
        <li>Put the blender on low; don't fully blend, but make sure there are no big chunks of pepper</li>
        <li>Measure 3/4 cups of rice and rinse well to remove starch, then pour into a sieve to drain water</li>
        <li>Pour one cooking spoon of oil into the pot and place on gas stove with medium heat</li>
        <li>Cut onions into small bits and pour into the pot when the oil is a little hot, just to add flavor</li>
        <li>Carefully pour the blended pepper into the pot and spread evenly with spoon</li>
        <li>Add the necessary spices: chicken broth, curry powder, thyme, knorr chicken cubes</li>
        <li>Stir the mixture and cover the pot. Let it cook for about 10 mins</li>
        <li>Now pour the sieved rice into the pot; be careful so as not to splash oil on skin!!!</li>
        <li>Add enough water just a little bit above the rice level and mix together</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the rice cook </li>
        <li>Check the rice every 5-10 mins to make sure there's enough water to cook it</li>
        <li>Taste the rice and add more spices if not enough</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, fry the shrimps, ground turkey/chicken, and the mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>When the rice is getting soft with little/no water, add the shrimps and others</li>
        <li>In case the rice color isn't red enough, add some tomato paste and mix well</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the rice simmer for about 10 mins with very low heat</li>
        <li>Finally, after about 30-40 mins, the rice should be properly done with no water</li>
