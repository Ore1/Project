        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Modupeoreoluwa, which means I thank God for God's gift. The short form and what everyone calls me is
        "Ore", meaning gift. I was born in Nigeria, West Africa and lived there all my life until I moved to the United States three
        years ago. I'm the eldest with a younger sister and brother. I graduated high school here in Chicago in 2015 and started 
        college at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. I'm in my second year; currently majoring in Information Technology and 
        Management. I do not have a specialization yet, but I'm thinking of going into cyber security. I'm also thinking of pusrsuing 
        masters coupled with my Bachelors in my current major. I see myself as a goal-oriented, curious, and easy-going person.
